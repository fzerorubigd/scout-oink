This is the final image :

## Problems

- I only keep the English manual (there are 3 of them in my copy), you can store them under the insert, but then the lid may be off for a few millimeter.
- The star tokens (scoring tokens) are a little tricky to fit in the space designated for them.

## Source

This is a based on my template to create and automate the build and release a parametric insert using 
[The Boardgame Insert Toolkit](https://github.com/dppdppd/The-Boardgame-Insert-Toolkit) 

Read [this article](https://medium.com/@fzerorubigd/a-ci-cd-for-creating-board-game-insert-1c685aaa1a4f) if you like to see how the template works.
